Adds version compatibility info to the plugins page to inform the admin at a glance if a plugin is compatible with the current WP version.

== Description ==

**Better Plugin Compatibility Control** makes it easy for the blog administrator to **check compatibility of all installed plugins**. The plugin adds version compatibility info to the plugins page to inform the admin at a glance if a plugin is compatible with the current WP version. Until now you had to look it up on the respective plugin page. It's now up to the admin wether to deactivate a non-compatible plugin or not.
